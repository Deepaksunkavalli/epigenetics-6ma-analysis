# Data Sources for 6mA Motif Analysis

This project relies on publicly available genomic and epigenetic resources.  The raw data themselves are **not** stored in this repository because they are large and maintained by their original providers.  To reproduce the analysis or extend it to other motifs or assemblies, download the following datasets from their official sources:

## Genome assemblies

| Assembly | Provider | Description | Retrieval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TAIR10** | Ensembl Plants / Arabidopsis Information Resource | The standard reference genome for *Arabidopsis thaliana*.  It consists of five chromosome sequences (Chr1–Chr5) and assorted scaffolds. | Visit Ensembl Plants (release 61 or later) and download the `Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.dna.toplevel.fa.gz` FASTA file.  Uncompress it with `gunzip` to obtain the multi‑FASTA file used for scanning. |
| **Col‑CEN (v1.2)** | Col‑CEN project / Schatzlab | A high‑quality assembly of the *A. thaliana* Columbia accession with fully resolved centromeres and telomeres.  This assembly adds ~12 Mb of new sequence compared to TAIR10 and is used to explore centromeric 6mA motifs. | The authors provide `Col‑CEN_v1.2.fasta.gz` via their GitHub releases.  Download this file, decompress it and use the resulting FASTA for motif scanning. |

## Epigenetic datasets

| Dataset | Provider | Description | Retrieval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Histone modification peaks** | ReMap 2022 project | ReMap curated 286 high‑quality histone ChIP‑seq datasets for *A. thaliana*, mapping 4.5 million peaks to TAIR10.  These peaks are used to assess whether 6mA motifs occur in active or repressive chromatin. | Navigate to the ReMap website (remap.univ‑amu.fr) and select the *Arabidopsis thaliana* histone dataset.  Download the BED files (per‑experiment or merged) and intersect them with the motif BED file using BEDTools. |

## Notes

* The derived BED and FASTA files generated by this project (e.g., motif positions and flanking windows) are provided in this repository under the names `GAGG_motif_positions.bed` and `GAGG_windows.fasta`.  These files were created using the Col‑CEN assembly with the default motif `GAGG` and a flanking window of 30 bp on each side.
* To analyse alternative motifs or assemblies, adjust the command‑line arguments of `6ma_motif_analysis.py` accordingly and re‑run the pipeline after obtaining the appropriate FASTA file.
